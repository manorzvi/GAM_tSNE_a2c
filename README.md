# Visualization of RL Agentsâ€™ Learning Process Using Prior-Based Modification Of t-SNE Algorithm
This project suggests a methodology to analyze the learning process of DRL agents. In this specific case we use A2C agents trained on the game Atari Breakout (Atari2600). 
The methodology we suggest is based on a modification to the t-SNE algorithm for dimensionality reduction, and introduces a way to maintain continuity between consecutive projections of the algorithm by introducing a prior-based approach.
